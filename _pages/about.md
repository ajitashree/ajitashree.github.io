## About Me

I am a fifth-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at [IIT Kanpur](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/), working in the [CoSmic Lab](https://zafar-lab.github.io/CoSmic-lab/) under the supervision of [Dr. Hamim Zafar](https://hamimzafar.wixsite.com/home). My research focuses on developing computational methods for single-cell and spatial transcriptomics datasets, leveraging techniques such as deep generative modeling and graph neural networks to address fundamental challenges in computational biology.

Previously, I completed M.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIT Delhi](https://homecse.iitd.ac.in/) advised by [Prof. Naveen Garg](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~naveen/). I also have industry experience at [GE Global Research](https://www.ge.com/news/reports/tag/global%20research%20center) and [GE Aviation](https://www.geaerospace.com/), where I contributed to the development of large-scale machine learning systems for flight scheduling, specifically focusing on engine failure forecasting for the international airline industry. I am also a graduate of GEâ€™s two-year Global Leadership Program, which included leadership assignments at GE Detroit and GE Hungary.
